## How to Use This Arsenal

### Scenario 1: Copycat Appears

**You:**
> "Per *Jacobsen v. Katzer*, 535 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008), GPL licenses are enforceable copyright licenses. You are in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 106. Cease immediately or face statutory damages under 17 U.S.C. § 504."

**Copycat:** *deletes repo within 24 hours*

### Scenario 2: VC Tries to "Reinvent" Your Idea

**You:**
> "Our work is protected under 17 U.S.C. § 102 as an original work of authorship. Trademark registration pending under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). We will pursue declaratory judgment if necessary."

**VC:** *backs off, invests instead*

### Scenario 3: Blog Calls You "Overhyped"

**You:**
> "That's potentially defamatory under California law. We're prepared to file an anti-SLAPP motion per Cal. CCP § 425.16 if you proceed. See also *Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid*, 490 U.S. 730 - our work is original and documented."

**Blog:** *issues correction*

### Scenario 4: GitHub DMCA Takedown (False)

**You:**
> "Per 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), false DMCA claims are actionable. We're filing a counter-notice. See *Oracle v. Google*, 141 S. Ct. 1183 - fair use applies. Prepare for damages."

**Fake claimant:** *withdraws immediately*
